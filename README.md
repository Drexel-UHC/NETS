# National Establishment Time Series (NETS) Dataset Processing
This repository houses the code for which to process NETS into Business Establishment Data Derived from NETS (BEDDN). It was created and continues to be maintained by the MESA Neighborhood & Aging team at the Urban Health Collaborative of Drexel University. The main branch houses code for NETS2022 processing, while the NETS2019 branch houses code for NETS2019 processing.

Contact stf45@drexel.edu for coding walkthrough and questions.
